The following project is a task created by Jordan Litsas & Nathan Cahill for their University assignment for SIT725. It is a web based application that creates a more streamlined way to rent properties within Australia as it was identified that current methods needed more legality. Using Real Easy Rental, users are able to create a profile, select which type of profile they want to dive deeper into and then have access to many functions from there on.


# How to run

npm i and npm start will start the web application for you to use.
